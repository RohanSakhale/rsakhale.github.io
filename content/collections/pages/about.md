> **"Given the right set of raw materials, it can be developed into a finished saleable product."**

Renowned as a **Software Mentor** by passion and an **Engineer** by profession, I bring over **15+ years of Web Development experience** as a Freelancer and **13+ years in the industry**. My journey, deeply influenced by [Prof. Rajesh Patkar](https://www.rajeshpatkar.com) (my mentor, my guru), has been a testament to transforming raw ideas into **scalable, efficient, and market-ready** digital solutions.

Beyond coding, I am passionate about **mentoring students** and sharing practical knowledge on **emerging tech trends, modern frameworks, and best coding practices**.
