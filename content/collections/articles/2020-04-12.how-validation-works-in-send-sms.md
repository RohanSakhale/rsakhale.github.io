Send SMS is a plugin by Sai Ashirwad Informatia that helps you send SMS easily anywhere over the globe by registering on [https://saiashirwad.in](https://saiashirwad.in) their platform.

<!-- more -->
The plugin does validate the receivers mobile number based on several factors before even sending message directly. This helps identify the junk data very easily and also saves credit as Exceptions are raised before the actual message is sent.

The verification feature is built on-top of authentic source available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_telephone_prefixes_by_country).

## What it does

This plugin verifies a list of items based on data available from Wikipedia

1. List allowed country code
2. Based on country code
   1. It validates the mobile number length, like in India it often is 10 digit, likewise in different countries it maintains the record of length
   2. Well, it also validates the start numbers, like people can't just enter random number and continue, it verifies the range of number is allowed

Either of the case fails, it throws an exception.

## How it works

This plugin periodically scans the Wikipedia using PHP WebDriver and maintains the data within offline accessible JSON file which is committed within the repository, also available offline for your validation needs.

Check this [WebDriver code](https://gitlab.com/SaiAshirwadInformatia/libraries/sendsms/PHP-Send-SMS/-/blob/master/src/saiashirwadinformatia/Services/GenerateDataByCountry.php) that generates the JSON for validation purpose.


[JSON data by countries](https://gitlab.com/SaiAshirwadInformatia/libraries/sendsms/PHP-Send-SMS/-/blob/master/src/saiashirwadinformatia/data/countries.json) you can cross-verify for authenticity.

$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$countryCode = '91';
$senderId = 'ABCDEF'; // PUT your approved Sender-Id
$route = SendSMS::TRANSACTION_ROUTE;

$smsClient = new SendSMS([
    'authkey' => $apiKey, 
    'countryCode' => $countryCode, 
    'senderId' => $senderId, 
    'route' => $route
]);

$mobile = '8888888888';
$message = 'Hello, this is your message!';
$countryCode = '91'; // dynamically change country code during each call
$senderId = 'TESTMM'; // dynamically set sender id for each SMS
$dltTemplateId = ''; // This is now mandatory to send SMS in authentic way
$success = $smsClient->send($dltTemplateId, $mobile, $message, $countryCode, 

$messageId = $success->getMessage();
echo $messageId;
```
