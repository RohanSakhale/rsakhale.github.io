Laravel often have easy way to resolve the Models from route bindings that are often shared as your primary id.

Ever wondered, if you don't want to expose the primary index of your entities to end-users in your route URL or response JSON, this package provides an amazing out-of-the-box solution with the help of HashId's package.

## Example

Your API or WEB url that often you shared let's say for User whose `id` is `1` would be

```
https://{host}/api/users/1

or

https://{host}/users/1/update
```

With this package the `id` would be updated to

```
https://{host}/api/users/aE41jhk41

or

https://{host}/users/aE41jhk41/update
```

Here `aE41jhk41` is a hash generated for id `1`.
## How it works

1. Secure Ids package makes use of [Laravel-Hashids](https://github.com/vinkla/laravel-hashids) for generating the secure hashes for your models
2. It identifies all your Model classes that would be present either within `app` or `app/Models` directory or you can specify the directory
3. For each model class it maintains a unique connection for generation of the id, this way the hash for `1` would be different for `App\Models\User` and similary hash for `1` in `App\Models\Role` would be totally different.
4. Additionally, it generates a unique salt with the help of `app.key` so as to keep generation of hash, unique for each project.

## How to use

### Installation

Install this package in your project with composer

```bash
composer require saiashirwadinformatia/secure-ids
```

Publish the config file used by this package

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="SaiAshirwadInformatia\SecureIds\SecureIdsServiceProvider"
```

Update the config file as required, often it auto identifies the basic structure of Laravel, change if you are using a separate structure.

```php
return [
    'models_directory' => 'Models',
    'model_namespace'  => 'App\\Models\\',
    'length'           => 13,
];
```

### Usage

Load the configs of SecureIds by calling in your AppServiceProvider boot method

```php
use SaiAshirwadInformatia\SecureIds\Facades\SecureIds;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        SecureIds::load();
    }
```

Use trait `HasSecureIds` for the models you want to enable securing the id.

```php
use SaiAshirwadInformatia\SecureIds\Models\Traits\HasSecureIds;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;
    // Add below Trait to enable securing id's
    use HasSecureIds;
    // ...
```

That's it done!

## What it does

1. With the above configuration you have enabled JSON response for API to include `id` with the `HashId`
2. If it's not API, the property to reference `HashId` is available as `$user->secure_id`
3. Ensure when passing in URL `secure_id` is passed so it auto-resolves the bindings
